# Whole workflow {#sec-workflow}

GRASS GIS allows one to execute add-ons directly from the command line or as Python commands, just like regular GRASS functions. Users can therefore easily chain the different add-on functions together by calling each function from the command line or within a Python script. By chaining these steps in a script, users can create a replicable pipeline that can be run repeatedly with different input data and parameter settings. This is an important advantage when modelling, which often involves running multiple iterations in which different parameter settings are tested and validated. The final section [5](5_workflow_automation.qmd) will demonstrate how all the steps from the previous sections can be chained together in one automated workflow.
