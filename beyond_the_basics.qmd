# Beyond the basics {#sec-advancedsteps}

In the previous sections, we covered the basic steps for building a species distribution model using Maxent. In this part, we'll explore various options to validating the results (@sec-modelvalidation) and fine-tune model options (@sec-modelfinetuning).

We will examine various validation methods and parameter adjustments, addressing each option individually. Itâ€™s important to keep in mind that that species distribution modeling is an iterative process: experimenting with different parameter combinations, validating the results, and refining the model to enhance performance. By understanding these aspects, you'll be better equipped to develop robust and reliable models.
